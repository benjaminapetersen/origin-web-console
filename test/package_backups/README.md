# Package backups

Primarily for Protractor as the package has problems with hitting github's ratelimits,
thus installation can be impossible.  

## Install Protractor Backup

If protractor & webdriver will not work due to github ratelimiting, then this command
will install a functioning version of protractor into the `node_modules` directory:

```
npm run install_protractor_backup
```
